My First Website

Project Name: Collections

Project Description: Since i plan to major in IM, i expect ill be creating a lot of cool projects and artworks throughout my IM major so I plan to update this website with everything I create as a way to keep track and share all my work.

Process: I started out with the overall design and look of the website. I honestly took way longer than I should've as I was being quite picky about the design but I went with a black and white minimalistic approach. i then took some inspiration from youtube and other video sharing websites with having my trailer as the main focus for now and adding a title and description in order to briefly explain the video's premise. I then added in some of the comments other students made during the trailer reveal on Zoom. I then added in images and a short intro for each of the team members who had a part in making this video along with their respectives roles. I was confused about what I should add for interactivity and decided to go with what I was picky about the most: design. So i added in multiple backgrounds that you can pick and choose from while viewing my website. I also had a slight theme in the backgrounds with them beeing light, dark, and sunset themed respectively.

Reflection: For my first ever website, I can say that I've definitely did well. i already have ideas on how to further imrpove my website and potentially other functionality i could add but for now, i am quite happy with it and look forward to how it evolves in the future.
